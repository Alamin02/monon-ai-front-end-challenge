# Monon AI take home assignment (Front End Engineer)

Thank you for choosing MononAI. This is a simple take home test for you to work on, so that on interview day, you have something that you know better than us and for us to learn from you.

You will see a file `employees.json` which includes a list of 20 employees along with their basic information and 90 days' worth attendance. Your task is to create two pages that represent those information.

The first page will include a table that includes the `name`, `email`, `department`, and `last seen` of all employees, paginated by page size of 10. Upon clicking each employee, you will be taken to a detail field of an employee that contains all the information (including Avatar image), and attendances in a table sorted in **descending order**. In the attendance table, in addition to `enter` and `exit`, you will also add a new computer column, `duration`.

Here are some addition tasks:

1. In the `List` page, allow user to sort by name, department, and email
2. You can use `ReactRouter` if you want for the page, but it is not mandatory
3. Using state management system is optional.
4. If you want to do the whole thing with Amy third party datatable lib, you are welcome to do so, remember, right tool for the right job is a great skill
5. (Optional and Bonus) In the detail Page's attendance table, make duration column sortable.

Please use "Create React App" (JavaScript or TypeScript) to create your app and send us the Github link once you are done. You will have 1 week to complete it after you receive this link, although solving it should not take more than 3/4 hours.


In the interview, you will be asked questions about your code and probably to extend it a bit. You will also be asked to improve it and comment on your thoughts on the data, you selection of libraries, you pattern of working etc. 

All data presented here are randomly generated and bears no resemblance with any real data.
